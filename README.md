# Menu-Randomizer-Final
------------------------------------------------------

This is the latest version of my Menu project. It was originally built for COP 200 Programming II and is currently being corrected in terms of security for CEN 3078 Computer Security.

# Project Reason
------------------------------------------------------
I created this project initially to help initiate my own creativity and increase my coding knowledge.
It has evolved over time to continue serving this purpose as well as perform its own function of providing a fun way of producing food menus.
